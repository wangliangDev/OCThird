## [Masonry](https://github.com/SnapKit/Masonry)

Masonry is still actively maintained, we are committed to fixing bugs and merging good quality PRs from the wider community. However if you're using Swift in your project, we recommend using SnapKit as it provides better type safety with a simpler API.
