 * ## [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage)
   This library provides an async image downloader with cache support. For convenience, we added categories for UI elements like UIImageView, UIButton, MKAnnotationView.


 * ## [FLAnimatedImage](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage)
   FLAnimatedImage is a performant animated GIF engine for iOS:
   - Plays multiple GIFs simultaneously with a playback speed comparable to desktop browsers
   - Honors variable frame delays
   - Behaves gracefully under memory pressure
   - Eliminates delays or blocking during the first playback loop
   - Interprets the frame delays of fast GIFs the same way modern browsers do
