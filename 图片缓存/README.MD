This library provides an async image downloader with cache support. For convenience, we added categories for UI elements like UIImageView, UIButton, MKAnnotationView.

[FLAnimatedImage](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage)

FLAnimatedImage is a performant animated GIF engine for iOS:

- Plays multiple GIFs simultaneously with a playback speed comparable to desktop browsers
- Honors variable frame delays
- Behaves gracefully under memory pressure
- Eliminates delays or blocking during the first playback loop
- Interprets the frame delays of fast GIFs the same way modern browsers do

It's a well-tested [component that powers all GIFs in Flipboard](http://engineering.flipboard.com/2014/05/animated-gif). To understand its behavior it comes with an interactive demo:
