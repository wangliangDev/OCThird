While developing iOS apps, we often run into issues where the iPhone keyboard slides up and covers the UITextField/UITextView. IQKeyboardManager allows you to prevent this issue of keyboard sliding up and covering UITextField/UITextView without needing you to write any code or make any additional setup. To use IQKeyboardManager you simply need to add source files to your project.
